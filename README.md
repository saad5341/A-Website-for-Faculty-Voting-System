# Faculty (Teachers) Voting System Website for Students Purpose

During my undergraduate years I have done this project in Database Management System (DBMS) course. This website is designed for students who can vote for their different course teachers based on their ratings. The main purpose of this website is to let the students know about the faculties/teachers before advising. Students can rate a faculty based on his/her teaching style, delivering skill, marking evaluation and behavior. There is 2 panels in this website, one is for students and the other one is for admins. Students can register an account by using an email and password. After login they can select a position (course teachers) and vote for him/her. A student can vote for a position (teacher) only once. Admins can add positions and candidates for each position. They can also modify, update and delete positions and candidates. Admins also have the right to modify any student member. This website is written in php, javascript, css and html.
