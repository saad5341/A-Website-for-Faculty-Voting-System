# Faculty (Teachers) Voting System Website for Students Purpose
During my undergraduate years I (with my group) have done this project in Database Management System (DBMS) course. This website is designed for students who can rate/vote for their different course teachers based on their teaching skills. The main purpose of this website is to let the students know about the faculties/teachers before advising. Students can rate a faculty based on his/her teaching style, delivering skill, marking evaluation and behavior. There are 2 panels in this website, one is for students and the other one is for admins. Students can register an account by using an email and password. After login, they can select a position (courses) and get the candidates (course teachers) for that course. Then they can select a teacher and vote for him/her. A student can vote for a candidate (teacher) only once. Admins can add positions and candidates for each position. They can also modify, update and delete positions and candidates. Admins also have the right to modify any student members.
# This website is written in PHP, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

# To run a demo of this project in localhost, please perform the following steps: 
1. Install XAMPP with Apache and MySQL modules. 
2. Download the entire 'uvote' folder as zip by clicking in 'code' and then 'Download ZIP' from my github repository.
3. Extract the zip and place the 'uvote' folder in 'htdoces' folder. The 'htdocs' folder can be found in your xampp installation directory. By default 'C:\xampp\htdocs'
4. Run xampp control and start both Apache and MySQL.
5. Then go to your browser (eg google chrome) and type 'http://localhost/phpmyadmin/'.
6. Create a new database named 'uvote'. After creating 'uvote' database, go to import and choose the .sql file located in 'uvote' folder.
7. After successfully importing, go to the browser and type 'http://localhost/uvote/'
8. You can use default student email which is 'student@example.com' and password is "1234".
9. For admin panel browse to 'http://localhost/uvote/admin'. Use default admin username "admin@example.com" and password "admin".
